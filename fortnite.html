<h2>Best Game Modes In Fortnite So Far</h2>

    <th>Game Mode</th>
    <th>Why</th>
    <th>Rating</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Solid Gold</td>
    <td>All the weapons were Legendary and it was good practice for battles due to all players having the same rarity weapons and was more even.</td>
    <td>9/10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Blitz Mode</td>
    <td>The storm comes in straight away and made way for shorter games and more chaos in game.</td>
    <td>8/10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Teams Of 20</td>
    <td>There was 5 teams of 20 and in my opinion with more people on your team it was better for getting Victory Royales</td>
    <td>7/10</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>50 vs 50</td>
    <td>Like Teams of 20.50 vs 50 was another great game mode to get Victory Royales but at times it got a bit to crazy in my opinion.</td>
    <td>7/10</td>

<p>It`s a really fun game mode.The storm comes in as soon as you land and unlike a normal match witch can be 20 minutes this one usually lasts about 15 minutes.</p>
    
    <h3>My Opinion:</h3><p>It is a really great game mode and well done to Epic Games on the new game mode and this should be an actual all year long game mode.</p>


    
 <h2>New Loot Drop:</h2>
    
<img src="http://cdn3-www.gamerevolution.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/fortnite-supply-llama.jpg">
    
    <h3>Supply Llama</h3>
    
    <p>There are 3 Supply Llamas on the map in each game they do not give you guns but they give you a lot of ammo and a few other consumables.</p>
    
    

    
      <h2>New Gun:</h2><img src="https://www.dexerto.com/app/uploads/2018/03/fortnite-heavy-shotgun-double-pump-battle-royale-626x314.jpg">
     <h3>Heavy shotgun</h3>
    
    <p>It is OK close range but it really shines when it comes to it`s long range abilities.But in my opinion it is just another double pump and will probably be changed very soon.</p>
